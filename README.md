# Battle Strike

Battle Strike Launcher is great to download making it easy to play all versions and play other DLC's

Battle Strike is a free realm economy server where you PVP a gain and make loot for not only money but to be the deadliest or friendliest player on server.
Battle Strike is inspired by Minecraft, Terreria, DonutSMP, and surviv.io all combined to one idea.
Now maybe wondering, Why is this a Server but not the game itself? And to that I say more servers instead of just one, such as a pvp server, zombie server, minigame server, by not only me but the community I can try to grow. 
# Battle DLC's

1v1 Battlegrounds is the first made prototype of Battle Strike. Go against an AI and win as much as you want but be careful because the AI is powerful. You can play this game on web!

Boss Battle is the closest one to show on progress I have made for Battle Strike. Funny enough Boss Battle is more ahead then Battle Strike in terms of progress. Find all ways to find and defeat bosses!
